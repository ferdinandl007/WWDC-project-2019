 ## Face Breakout
 Face breakout makes use of ` SpriteKit`, `CIDetector`, `UIKit` and `ARKit`  to create an accessible game for everyone.  By leveraging CIDetector Face Tracking for gameplay, that does not require physical actions to play it. My source of inspiration comes from the desire to create apps that improve peoples lives.
 Playing dynamic games, such as Breakout is not particularly easy for people who are paraplegic.
 Therefore, I got inspired to solve this problem by using Face Tracking to dynamically track the direction in which the user looks at for   pedal control.

 # How to play!
 #### Important hold the device landscape to ensure face tracking works correctly.
 Use your head motion such as looking left or right to control the pedal on the screen. With the goal being to remove as many blocks as possible! Try cracking your High Score and most importantly, have fun playing!
